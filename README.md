# Electronics Design Calculator App
This is a simple design calulator app for some of the main transistor-based circuit components used in Electronics Engineering, such as Diodes, Op-Amps, MOSFETs, and BJTs.

The app's main purpose is to streamline the systems-level circuit design phase by reducing/removing the need for lookup (or rote memorization) of arbitrary formulas, and helps prevent human error from hand calculations.

## Setup
...

## Usage
- Select a circuit template to use, from all the component's most common layout configurations (typically < 5)
- Select a parameter of interest to solve for, then plug in the parameter values you know (or assumed values)
- The same formulas used internally to do the calculations are also shown with the circuit diagram, formatted via LaTeX
